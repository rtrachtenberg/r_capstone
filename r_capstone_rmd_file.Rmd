# Abalone Age Prediction

## Introduction

The abalone dataset, downloaded from the AppliedPredictiveModeling R package (which can be accessed at this [link](https://github.com/cran/AppliedPredictiveModeling/tree/master/data)), contains 4,177 instances of physical and qualitative observations of this type of marine snail. The data originated from a 1995 study conducted by UC Irvine and contains the following data:

| Variable Name | Variable Type | Units       | Description                                                     |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Sex           | Categorical   | NA          | Split into 3 categories: M (Male), F (Female), and I (Immature) |
| LongestShell  | Continuous    | millimeters | Abalone length measured from ends of longest shell              |
| Diameter      | Continuous    | millimeters | Abalone shell diameter (perpendicular to longest shell length)  |
| Height        | Continuous    | millimeters | Abalone height, including meat within shell                     |
| WholeWeight   | Continuous    | grams       | Whole abalone weight                                            |
| ShuckedWeight | Continuous    | grams       | Weight of abalone flesh (not including exoskeleton or shell)    |
| VisceraWeight | Continuous    | grams       | Gut weight after bleeding                                       |
| ShellWeight   | Continuous    | grams       | Shell weight only (after being dried)                           |
| Rings         | Integer       | NA          | Number of abalone rings observed, used to derive age in years   |

According to the researchers that piloted the 1995 study, the age of an abalone is determined by cutting and staining the shell, followed by analysis under microscope, which is a cumbersome task. All information regarding the origin of this data can be found in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository archives, [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone). The goal of this project is to see if the measurements already a part of this dataset can be used to predict the age instead of using time-consuming and invasive procedures.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
